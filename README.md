## **How to Use**
ÔºàFrom Owner avatar lyonville-frontend's Readme file)
Please contact The Duy Nguyen from HillClimbers for any queries and issues with setting up node_modules and running unit tests and linters. Firstly, ensure that you have installed npm or yarn. Then, do as follows:

Clone the main repository. Then git switch to your team's branch (you might need to fetch)
Run git branch (to ensure that you're on your team's branch, such as i-want-h1 or damolab, instead of main).
Copy all of your coding files to the respective folders that are present in this template.
For example, you have an Events page file, Events.jsx. Then you might want to move that to src/pages.
Likewise, if you have a Navigation Bar component, NavBar.jsx, then you can move that to src/components.
These steps ensure that you have all necessary and secure dependencies specified in package.json, and a complete .gitignore. Now, use the following commands:

npm install (install everything to node_modules)
npm run dev (to make sure vite is working properly)
npm run lint (JS linter to improve code quality; if this shows errors, you must correct your code as per what the error is telling you)
npm run tsc (loose type check)
After you've ensured everything is running fine with no errors, do as follows:

Run git push (push your code on your team's branch)
Go onto GitHub, check the icon next to your commit to see the status of the CI tests, it will be either üü† (currently running), ‚ùå (failed), or ‚úÖ (successful).
If failed, see the failed tests and please correct your code or contact me.
If succeeded, go to next step.
Create a Pull Request and wait for approval.
